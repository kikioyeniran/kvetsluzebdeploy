Ideally, jot down a list of cleaning priorities for your cleaner (you can do it per room, or for your entire home). This will help them to focus on the areas that are important to you. When your cleaner arrives, give them a tour and highlight your priorities and any fragile surfaces or items. Don’t forget to show the cleaner where to find your cleaning products and if you have any preferences or surfaces that need special care, make sure to let your cleaner know.
